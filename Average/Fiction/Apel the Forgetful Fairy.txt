One day, she had to take some magical flowers to the elves in the forest, but she left them at home. Unable to go back in time, Apel couldn't retrieve the flowers, risking the elves' disappointment. Sadly, she returned without them, and the elves were let down.Realizing her forgetfulness, Apel felt the weight of her actions. To make amends, she apologized and vowed to bring the flowers first thing the next day. That night, Apel reflected on the importance of keeping promises. She decided to set reminders to avoid forgetting things in the future.

From then on, Apel transformed into a punctual and responsible fairy, never missing a deadline. Over time, she earned the respect and trust of everyone in the land.The lesson gained is that even our small weaknesses can impact those around us. Being responsible and keeping promises is crucial to preventing unnecessary hardships for others.
