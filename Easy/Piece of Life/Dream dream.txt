Dream dream

"Dave, laruin mo ha, rank yan!", Richard, one of my classmates said leaving me dumbfounded. My chinky eyes automatically stared at the phone left in my hand. With utmost curiosity, I tried to maneuver the game. My interest rose as I saw the name of the game - Mobile Legends: Bang Bang.

Completely interested, I downloaded the app in my RealMe 9i and played consistently. Until I became the first player to reach the highest rank - Mythical Immortal. 

Disturbing sounds of numerous calls from agencies shocked me, and offers from companies arrived. But along with numerous opportunities, many people still underestimate this sport, as well as my capacity.

As I start my journey to be one of the most prominent players of this game, many bumps and problems have been encountered. Blood, sweat and tears were sacrificed just to reach my dream. 

But it became all worth it and my life changed. With all the hard work and perseverance, I'm now a prominent personality in the world of online games. 

Hilarious may it sound and people may disagree with me but with my frail and small body, I'm an athlete. A player of sports, an online sport - Esports. 

An athlete. This is how they address us. With no muscular strength and endurance needed, I'm called an athlete. 

As the rays of the sun entered my room, I opened my eyes with a faint smile and  slowly realized everything. 'Parang totoo yun ah'.
