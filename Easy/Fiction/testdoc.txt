Apel the forgetful fairy


Once upon a time, in a faraway land, there lived a fairy named Apel. Apel was the kindest fairy in the land. Everyone who knew her always had something nice to say about her. However, she had one problem: she was very forgetful. One day, Apel needed to deliver some magical flowers to the elves who lived in the forest, but she forgot them at her house. She couldn't fly back home to collect the flowers because she's too late, and if she didn't reach the elves on time, they wouldn't be able to use the flowers for their magical potions. Sadly, Apel returned empty-handed, and as she expected, the elves were very disappointed. Seeing the disappointment in their eyes, Apel immediately apologized and promised to deliver the flowers first thing in the morning. That night, Apel thought about her forgetfulness, and she realized how important it was to always remember what we promised to others. She decided to set reminders for herself so that she would never forget anything again. From that day on, Apel became the most punctual and responsible fairy in their land. She finally delivered everything on time and never forgot anything. Eventually, she gained everyone's respect and trust. The lesson that we learned was that our small weaknesses can cause the people around us to suffer, so it's very important to always be responsible and keep our promises.
