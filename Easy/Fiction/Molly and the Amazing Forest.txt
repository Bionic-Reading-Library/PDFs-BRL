Molly and the Amazing Forest

	Once upon a time, in a magical forest, there was a little girl named Molly. Molly really liked reading books and imagining different worlds. One day, she saw that some animals in the forest were not treated nicely by the others. Molly felt she needed to help, so she gathered all the animals and talked to them about being nice and accepting each other. They listened and started to appreciate the things that made each of them different. Now, all the animals are friends. Molly is known as the one who looks out for everyone and makes sure they all get along.

From then on, Molly inspired others to be accepting and showed them that even a little talk can make a big difference. She also taught them how to be kind. and friendly. Eventually, the forest became a more welcoming and loving place. where all the creatures lived happily together, no matter how different they were.
