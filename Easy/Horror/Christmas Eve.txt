Christmas Eve 

It was exactly 7pm, 24th of December 2007. I was cleaning our house for Christmas Eve when I heard my late husband’s voice saying my name. “Juliet, I'm home my love” he said softly then, I felt like someone touched me, someone hugged me. “Hi, love the kids are in their rooms wrapping the gifts that they will give to each other” I said but I didn’t get a reply from him, it felt so weird because knowing my husband he loves talking to me about the kids. “Aren’t you going to check the kids out?” I said but still didn’t get a reply from him “you okay love?” I asked but still no reply. He’s still hugging me but he’s not replying nor moving so I turned around but what shocked me is that my husband’s not there. It’s weird since he just hugged me a while ago. I cannot go wrong; I know his smell. “Mom, who are you talking to?” my daughter asked “no one baby, mommy’s just singing” I lie. I felt really scared when she asked me that because all this time, I thought my husband was here. I called my kids to eat, and we sat in the dining room. “Mom, I saw daddy earlier” my 5-year-old son said, “really baby? where?” I asked. “He’s outside my room earlier and he’s beside you now mommy” my son said. My soul left my body when I heard that. My husband died in a car crash last year. I looked at the empty chair beside me and there I saw my late husband grinning at me. “Merry Christmas love”.
